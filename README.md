## Details

### Styles

Styles and design library is built on top of shadCN and Tailwind

### Roadmap

There is a bare-bones admin panel behind supabase auth right now. You can access it at /admin. I will expand upon it with charts or create a separate admin panel that is usable across many apps with functionality to create tables, columns, rows, and storage buckets.
